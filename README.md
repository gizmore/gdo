# gdo
Ruby port/recode inspired by GDO6 (PHP). An (almost) no dependency slim website framework.


If you like PHP, please try out https://github.com/gizmore/gdo6
It is a next generation DBA and website framework done from scratch.

This project here is a recode/port to ruby, because PHP has it's limits; dynamic code reload, no exceptions in 'toString', Threading?, and maybe more.

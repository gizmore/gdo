# GDO(Ruby)

This is the official ruby port of GDO6(PHP).

This is a working draft since 2 or 3 weeks now.
Assume this to be unstable (the API will change) and shitty (stupid design estethics and inconsitencies),
but maybe there will be a real "gdor"(Ruby) successor soon.

## What is GDO?

GDO(Ruby) is short for "gizmore data objects".

GDO(Ruby) is the successor of GDO6(PHP) https://github.com/gizmore/gdo6

GDO is a framework that combines all my knowledge and experience from various frameworks into one single, low dependency framework.

It comes with an own DBA (no ActiveRecord) and, as stated above, has almost no dependencies.

GDO is test driven.

This is work in progress.
Check back soon!
